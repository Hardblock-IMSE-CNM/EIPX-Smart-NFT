## Simple Summary
A Standar interface to Smart Non Fungible Tokens binded a IoT devices thats generate their own blockchain account.

## Abstract
Current Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) allow representing assets by a unique identifier, as a possession of an owner. The novelty introduced in this EIP is the proposal of smart NFTs to represent IoT devices, which are physical smart assets. Hence, they are also identified as the utility of a user, they have a blockchain account (BCA) address to participate actively in the blockchain transactions, they can establish secure communication channels with owners and users, and they operate dynamically with several modes associated with their token states. A smart NFT is physically bound to its IoT device thanks to the use of a physical unclonable function (PUF) that allows recovering its private key and, then, its BCA address.
 
## Motivation
Current NFTs are designed like pasive assets, and this assets only have an owner, or in the best of case a manager for an owner. In the Smart Contract literature apear a lot of projects about renting, or managment system of tokens. In this proposal we introduce the role of user and the role of device. The device must create its own identity to know its state, its user and its owner. Owner can not lose the ownership when let use the device to an user, and users can use the device without obtain the ownership of a device, only a user permition. In addition the device known in each moment who can use it. This proposal make easier a lots of projects using Smart Non Fungible token binded to a Smart Device.

## Specification
This kind of non-fungible token must be associated to a secure device that need to have the capacity to generate its own blockchain account, and safe it on a secure memory or using any secure algorithm to save it like SRAM PUF or similar. And only the manufacturer can create the token. This is for secure purpose. And the manufacturer is the responsible of the smart contract. Its mean that each manufacturer need to be its own smart contract to interact with its own tokens. The manufactuter define de bootloader that define the account saved on the device. 
Owner have de capacity of transfer and update the firmware of the tokens, but owner can not overwrite the bootloader layer described to the manufacturer. To do this, the firmware must be sign by manufacturer in a secure bootloader process. Owner assign a user to use the token, if a owner need to use the token need to assign itself like user. Depending of how is described the smart contract an owner can decline the use of the token of an user.
Only a user can use the token, the user can define some parameters of token but never upload any firmware. This firmware is defined by the manufacturer or the owner.
To complete a token transaction the new owner must authenticate offchain and onchain whith the token using their blockchain account. The smart contract define how owner start a new authentication and how the token can complete this autentication. This autentication is necesary to the device know who is its owner and stay secure that is not an impostor. In the same way, the smart contract define how the user and device must be authenticate in the same way.

## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

## Backwards Compatibility
All EIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The EIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. EIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

## Test Cases
Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other EIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.

## Reference Implementation
An optional section that contains a reference/example implementation that people can use to assist in understanding or implementing this specification.  If the implementation is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`.

## Security Considerations
All EIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. EIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An EIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.
