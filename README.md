## Simple Summary
A standar interface of Smart Non Fungible Tokens representing smart assets (such as secure IoT devices) that generate their own blockchain accounts.

## Abstract
Current Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) allow representing assets by a unique identifier, as a possession of an owner. The novelty introduced in this EIP is the proposal of smart NFTs, SmartNFTs, to represent smart assets such as IoT devices, which are physical smart assets. Smart assets can have a blockchain account (BCA) address to participate actively in the blockchain transactions, they are also identified as the utility of a user, they can establish secure communication channels with owners and users, and they operate dynamically with several operating modes associated with their token states. A smart NFT is physically bound to a smart asset, for example an IoT device, because the device is the only one able to generate its BCA address from its private key. The physical asset is the only one in possesion of its private key. This can be ensured, for example, if the IoT device does not store the private key but uses a physical unclonable function (PUF) that allows recovering its private key.
 
## Motivation
Current NFTs are designed to represent passive assets, which only have an owner that owns the token, can transfer ownership, and can approve others to act in its name. However, there are nowadays many smart assets, like IoT devices, that can interact actively with other blockchain participants, that is, they can have a BCA. Hence, we propose the addition of the NFT attribute "device", which is the BCA address associated with the physical smart asset. Besides, the smart asset is not only a possession of an owner but also an active agent that obeys to a user to carry out certain tasks in an application. Hence, we propose the addition of the NFT attribute "user", which is the BCA address of the user of the smart asset. In order to represent the secure dynamic activity of the smart asset, six more attributes are proposed: "timestamp", "timeout", "state", "hashK_OD", "hashK_UD", and "dataEngage".  The attribute "timestamp" registers in the blockchain whenever the smart asset checks it is bound to its token. The attribute "timeout" is the maximum delay time established for the asset to prove again the bounding. Token "state" is included to trace the operating mode of the smart asset while "hashK_OD", "hashK_UD", and "dataEngage" are public data added to trace if secure communication channels are established between the smart asset and its owner and user.

## Specification
 
This kind of non-fungible token is designed to represent a secure smart asset with the capacity of generating its own BCA and, hence, interacting with the blockchain. Besides, this SmartNFT can assign the token to a user and establish secure communication channels with the owner and user. SmartNFTs can be considered as improved ERC721 tokens.
 
In order to avoid asset counterfeiting, it is important that the private key of the asset from which its BCA is derived could not be known by anyone except for the asset itself. This can be achieved in IoT devices by using a PUF or a trusted module like a TPM. Only the device manufacturer can generate a new SmartNFT linked to the identity of the device. The manufacturer is in charge of compiling an providing the trusted firmmware to generate the device BCA. After executing a secure boot, the device can upload the owner and user firmwares. Owner and user firmwares cannot extract imformation from the device private key because they cannot overwrite the bootloader layer described by the manufacturer. To ensure this, the manufacturer firmware can be signed and the signature can be checked in a secure boot process. The owner is in charge of assigning a user to the token (the owner itself can be assigned as user). Only a user can use the token.
 
In order to complete a token transaction, a new owner must carry out a mutual authentication process offchain with the asset and onchain with the token, by using their blockchain accounts. Similarly, a new user must carry out a mutual authentication process. SmartNFTs define how the authentication processes start and finish. These autentication processes allow deriving fresh session cryptographic keys for secure communication between assets and owners, and between assets and users. Therefore, the trustworthiness of the assets can be traced even if new owners and users manage them. These processes are described below.
 
![Figure 1 : State diagram of the token](/Images/Figure1.png)

A smart asset, for example an IoT device, is a dynamic asset with several operating modes, which are represented by states in SmartNFTs. In particular, the states defining if the asset has been engaged or not with an owner or with a user deserve attention (for example, in the case of an IoT device, because the software to be executed by the device, which should be verified prior to be executed, is different). Hence, we propose the addition of the SmartNFT attribute "state" and propose that the operating mode of the asset should be in correspondence with its token state. We consider four main states of the token. The state "Waiting for owner" defines the situation whenever the token is created or transferred to a new owner but asset and owner have not verified mutually yet. Once they verify each other, the asset recognizes its owner and the state of its token changes to "Engaged with owner". In this state, the owner can transfer the token to a user. If the token is transferred to a user that coincides with the owner, the token state changes to "Engaged with user" and the asset is ready to operate in its application, obeying the commands from its user. Otherwise, the token changes its state to "Waiting for user". Once the user and the asset are verified mutually, the token changes its state to "Engaged with user". From this state, the token can be transferred to another user, thus returning to "Waiting for user" state. To cope with a user that could not reply, the token can be transferred to another user if its state is "Waiting for user". From all the states, the token can be transferred to another owner, thus returning to "Waiting for owner" state. Figure 1 illustrates the state diagram of the token. The state changes are controlled by token functions as explained below.

This interface is an extension of the ERC721, is compatible with the standard, and needs the ERC721 interface. ERC721 interface is available in https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721. Then, metadata and enumeration extensions are compatible and included in this draft.
 
## Rationale
This SmartNFT was developed because the ERC721 standard does not define the "users" of an asset, only the "owners", and does not assign a blockchain account (BCA) address, "device", to the asset. Smart assets (for example IoT devices) are increasing nowdays and they are managed in a secure way if they are bound to SmartNFTs. SmartNFTs allow implementing a secure way to share a secret key between the owner and the device and between the user and the device, confirmed with the consensus of the blockchain. In this way, devices, owners, and users can ensure that they are exchanging information only with  trusted parts.

**Secure Device bound to a SmartNFT**
 
Current non-fungible tokens are associated with passive assets, either virtual or physical things, but they do not include any standardized mechanism to bind the non-fungible token to the asset. Bounding assets to NFTs is interesting because the "device" can know anytime its "owner" and "user". The "device" is an active part in any transfer of ownership and use. In addition, the "device" is smart, for example to revoke orders from a non-authorized user, or to be inoperative until the authentication with the user or the owner is carried out.
 
**Users Management Mechanism**
 
SmartNFTs allow implementing a new and useful user management mechanism. In the last few years many projects concerning assets sharing (for example vehicles) have been created and developed. We incorporate the blockchain account of the user of the token as another attribute in order to distinguish between users, who employ the asset for an expecific application, and owners, who assign the token to users. Both users and owners can be traced by the blockchain.
 
**Secure Key Exchange Mechanism**
 
The engagements of the device with an owner and a user are carried out after a mutual authentication protocol based on elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol. This protocol can be employed for a key agreement between the device and its owner, in the one side, and the device and its user, in the other side. 
 
When the SmartNFT is created or when the owmnership is transfered, the operating mode of the device defined by the token state is "Waiting for owner". Then, the device saves in its memory the owner BCA address. The owner generates a pair of keys using the elliptic curve secp256k1 and the primitive element P used on this curve: a secret key (SK<sub>OD</sub>) and a Public Key (PK<sub>OD</sub>), so that PK<sub>OD</sub> = SK<sub>OD</sub>*P. To generate the shared key between owner and device, (K<sub>O</sub>), the public key of the device, (PK<sub>dev</sub>), is employed as follows:
 
K<sub>O</sub>=PK<sub>dev</sub>*SK<sub>OD</sub>

Using the function startOwnerEngagement, the owner saves PK<sub>OD</sub> and the hash of K<sub>O</sub> in the SmartNFT. The owner sends PK<sub>OD</sub> signed to device. The device checks the signature to verify the identity of the owner and calculates:
 
K<sub>OD</sub> = SK<sub>dev</sub>*PK<sub>OD</sub>:

If everything is correctly done, K<sub>O</sub> and K<sub>OD</sub> are the same since:
 
K<sub>O</sub>=PK<sub>dev</sub>*SK<sub>OD</sub>=(SK<sub>dev</sub>*P)*SK<sub>OD</sub>= SK<sub>dev</sub>*(SK<sub>OD</sub>*P)=SK<sub>dev</sub>*PK<sub>OD</sub>

Using the function ownerEngagement, the device sends the K<sub>OD</sub> obtained and if it is the same as K<sub>O</sub>, then the state of the token changes to "Engaged with owner" and the event OwnerEngaged is sent. Once the device receives the event, it changes its operation mode to "Engaged with owner". This process is shown in Figure 2. From this moment, the device can be managed by the owner. 
 
 ![Figure 2 : Steps in successful owner and device muthual authentication](/Images/Figure2.PNG)
 
If the device consults the blockchain and the state of its SmartNFT is "Waiting for user", the device saves in its memory the user BCA address. Then, a mutual authentication process is carried out with the user, as already done with the owner. If the user verifies the device, the user sends the transaction associated with the function startUserEngagement. As in starOwnerEngagement, this function saves the public key generated by the user, PK<sub>UD</sub>, and the hash of K<sub>U</sub>=PK<sub>dev</sub>*SK<sub>UD</sub>.
The user sends PK<sub>UD</sub> signed to the device. The latter checks the signature and optionally checks PK<sub>UD</sub> on the attribute dataEngagement of its token. If the user is verified, the device calculates:

K<sub>UD</sub> = SK<sub>dev</sub>*PK<sub>UD</sub>:

If everything is correctly done, K<sub>U</sub> and K<sub>UD</sub> are the same since:
 
K<sub>U</sub>=PK<sub>dev</sub>*SK<sub>UD</sub>=(SK<sub>dev</sub>*P)*SK<sub>UD</sub>= SK<sub>dev</sub>*(SK<sub>UD</sub>*P)=SK<sub>dev</sub>*PK<sub>UD</sub>

Using the function userEngagement, the device sends the K<sub>UD</sub> obtained and if it is the same as K<sub>U</sub>, then the state of the token changes to "Engaged with user" and the event UserEngaged is sent. Once the device receives the event, it changes its operation mode to "Engaged with user". This process is shown in Figure 3. From this moment, the device can be managed by the user. 
 
 ![Figure 3 : Steps in successful user and device muthual authentication](/Images/Figure3.PNG)

Since the establishment of a shared secret is very important for a secure communication, we propose the inclusion of the attributes hashK_OD, hashK_UD, and dataEngage in the SmartNFT. The first two attributes define, respectively, the hash of the secret shared between the device and its owner and between the device and its user. Devices, owners, and users should check they are using the correct shared secrets. The attribute dataEngage defines the public data needed for the agreement. If the mutual authentication fails, dataEngage allows detecting which parts failed.
  
## Backwards Compatibility
This implementation is an extension of the ERC-721 standard, then it is not only compatible with the standard, but also is a way to improve some of the actual NFT tokens based on the ERC-721 standard.

## Test Cases
The test case presented on the paper showed below is addressed in <b>0x7eB5A03E7ED70ABf70fee48965D0411d37F335aC</b> and the code is available in <b>https://github.com/Hardblock-IMSE/Smart-Non-Fungible-Token</b>

## Reference Implementation
A first version was presented in a paper of the Special Issue <b>Security, Trust and Privacy in New Computing Environments)</b> of <b>Sensors</b> journal of <b>mdpi</b> editorial. The paper, entitled <b><k>Secure Combination of IoT and Blockchain by Physically Binding IoT Devices to Smart Non-Fungible Tokens Using PUFs</k></b>, was written by the same authors of this draft. The doi of this paper is: <b>https://doi.org/10.3390/s21093119</b>

## Security Considerations
In this draft, a generic system has been proposed for the creation of non-fungible tokens able to represent smart assets. A generic point of view based on the improvements to the current ERC-721 standard is provided, such as the implementation of the user management mechanism, which does not affect the token's ownership.
The main objective is to bind a smart physical asset with a non-fungible token. The physical asset should have the ability to generate a blockchain account from itself in a totally random way so that only the asset is able to know the secret from which the blockchain account is generated. In this way, identity theft is avoided and the asset can be proven to be completely genuine. In order to ensure this, it is recommended that only the manufacturer of the asset has the ability to create its associated token, since it is intended to be backward compatible. In the case of an IoT device, the device firmware will be unable to share and modify the secret. It is recommended that assets reconstruct their secrets from non-sensitive information such as the data helper using PUFs. Although a secure key exchange system has been proposed, the token is open to coexist with other types of key exchange.
