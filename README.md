## Simple Summary
A Standar interface to Smart Non Fungible Tokens binded a IoT devices thats generate their own blockchain account.

## Abstract
Current Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) allow representing assets by a unique identifier, as a possession of an owner. The novelty introduced in this EIP is the proposal of smart NFTs to represent IoT devices, which are physical smart assets. Hence, they are also identified as the utility of a user, they have a blockchain account (BCA) address to participate actively in the blockchain transactions, they can establish secure communication channels with owners and users, and they operate dynamically with several modes associated with their token states. A smart NFT is physically bound to its IoT device thanks to the use of a physical unclonable function (PUF) that allows recovering its private key and, then, its BCA address.
 
## Motivation
Current NFTs are designed like pasive assets, and this assets only have an owner, or in the best of case a manager for an owner. In the Smart Contract literature apear a lot of projects about renting, or managment system of tokens. In this proposal we introduce the role of user and the role of device. The IoT device can interact actively with other blockchain participants, that is, it can have a BCA. Hence, we propose the addition of the NFT attribute device, which is the BCA address associated with the IoT device. Besides, an IoT device is not only a possession of an owner but also an active agent that obeys to a user to carry out certain tasks in an application. Hence, we propose the addition of the NFT attribute user, which is the BCA address of the user of the IoT device. In order to represent the dynamic activity of the IoT device, six more attributes are proposed: timestamp, timeout, state, hashK_OD, hashK_UD, and dataEngage.  The first of them, timestamp, registers in the blockchain whenever the device checks it is bound with its token. This is very important to register if the bound is alive or not. timeout define how many time is the maximum time to update timestamp from device to be considered still on live.

## Specification


 
This kind of non-fungible token is designend to associated with a secure device with the capacity of generateits own BCA and interact with the BC. And this SmartNFT is designed to assign the token to a user if its necesary. But this SmartNFT can be used like an improved ERC721 token. This mean that an normal token can be improve with managment of user system of this kind of token. Or only to interaction of token binded to a device without users.
 
In the original desing is important that the device can save securely its BCA and not share it to avoid a spoofed device. This BCA can be save using a SRAM PUF o a truth memory zone. Only manufacturer can generate a new token, that ensures the identity of the device. And only manufacturer can compile the an provide the firmware to regenerate the BCA of the device. This firmware serves like a bootloader to upload the owner or user firmware. This firmware cant modify the data require to generate the BCA, and can not recover the secrect key of the BCA. Owner have de capacity of transfer and update the firmware of the tokens, but owner can not overwrite the bootloader layer described to the manufacturer. To do this, the firmware must be sign by manufacturer in a secure bootloader process. Owner assign a user to use the token, if a owner need to use the token need to assign itself like user. Depending of how is described the smart contract an owner can decline the use of the token of an user. Only a user can use the token.
 
To complete a token transaction the new owner must authenticate offchain and onchain whith the token using their blockchain account. The smart contract define how owner start a new authentication and how the token can complete this autentication. This autentication is necesary to the device know who is its owner and stay secure that is not an impostor. In the same way, the smart contract define how the user and device must be authenticate in the same way. This process is descrive below.
 
![Figure 1 : State diagram of the token](/Images/Figure1.png)

An IoT device is a dynamic asset that can change of operating modes, which can be represented by states. In particular, the states defining if the device has been engaged or not with an owner or with a user deserve attention because the software to be executed by the device, which should be verified prior to be executed, is different. Hence, we propose the addition of the NFT attribute state and propose that the operating mode of the device should be in correspondence with its token state. We consider four main states of the to-ken. The state Waiting for owner defines the situation whenever the token is created or transferred to a new owner but device and owner have not verified mutually yet. Once they verify each other, the device recognizes its owner and the state of its token changes to Engaged with owner. In this state, the owner can transfer the token to a user. If the token is transferred to a user that coincides with the owner, the token state changes to Engaged with user and the device is ready to operate in its application, obeying the commands from its user. Otherwise, the token changes its state to Waiting for user. Once the user and the IoT device are verified mutually, the token changes its state to Engaged with user. From this state, the token can be transferred to another user, thus returning to Waiting for user state. To cope with a user that could not reply, the token can be transferred to another user if its state is Waiting for user. From all the states, the token can be transferred to another owner, thus returning to Waiting for owner state. Figure 1 illustrates the state diagram of the token. The state changes are controlled by token functions as explained below.
 
The engagements of the device with an owner and with a user are carried out after mutual authentication protocols based on elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocols. These protocols allow a key agreement between the device and its owner, in the one side, and the device and its user, in the other side. 
 
When the Smart NFT is created or when the owmnership is transfered, the operating mode of the device defined in the state is Waiting for owner. then the device saves in its memory the owner BCA address. Owner generate a pair of keys using secp256k1. A secret key (SK<sub>OD</sub>) and a Public Key (PK<sub>OD</sub>). To generate the key between owner and device (K<sub>OD</sub>) is need the public key of device (PK<sub>dev</sub>) and the point P such that PK<sub>OD</sub> = SK<sub>OD</sub>*P.
 
K<sub>OD</sub>=PK<sub>dev</sub>*SK<sub>OD</sub>

Using startOwnerEngage, owner save PK<sub>OD</sub> and the hash of K<sub>OD</sub> in the smart contract. Owner send PK<sub>OD</sub> signed to device. The device check the sign to verify the identity of the owner and calculate K<sub>OD</sub> using P such that PK<sub>dev</sub> = SK<sub>dev</sub>*P.

K<sub>OD</sub>=PK<sub>dev</sub>*SK<sub>OD</sub>=(SK<sub>dev</sub>*P)*SK<sub>OD</sub>= SK<sub>dev</sub>*(SK<sub>OD</sub>*P)=SK<sub>dev</sub>*PK<sub>OD</sub>

Using ownerEngage function, the device send K<sub>OD</sub> obtain and if it is the same Key then changes the state of the token to Engaged with owner and sends the event OwnerEngaged. Once the device receives the event, it changes its operation mode to Engaged with owner. This process is shown in <b>Figure 3</b>. From this moment, the device can be managed by the owner. 
 
If the device consults the blockchain and the state of its Smart NFT is Waiting for user, the device saves in its memory the user BCA address. Then, a mutual authentication process is carried out with the user, as already done with the owner. If the user verifies the device, the user sends the transaction associated to the function startUserEngage to the smart contract. Analogously to starOwnerEngage this function save the public key generated by user PK<sub>UD</sub> and the hash of PK<sub>dev</sub>*SK<sub>UD</sub>.
User send PK<sub>UD</sub> signed to device that check the signature an optionally check PK<sub>UD</sub> on the dataEngage attribute of its token. If verify its user, call userEngage function in the smartcontract with K<sub>UD</sub> such that
 
K<sub>UD</sub>=PK<sub>dev</sub>*SK<sub>UD</sub>=(SK<sub>dev</sub>*P)*SK<sub>UD</sub>= SK<sub>dev</sub>*(SK<sub>UD</sub>*P)=SK<sub>dev</sub>*PK<sub>UD</sub>

 The smart contract compare if K<sub>UD</sub>=PK<sub>dev</sub>*SK<sub>UD</sub> and if it is equal, then changes the state of the token to Engaged with user and sends the event UserEngaged. Once the device receives the event, it changes its operation mode to Engaged with user. This process is shown in <b>Figure 4</b>. 

 
 
Since the establishment of a shared secret is very important for a secure communication between them, we propose the inclusion of the attributes hashK_OD, hashK_UD, and dataEngage. The first two attributes define, respectively, the hash of the secret shared between the device and its owner and between the device and its user. Devices, owners, and users should check they are using the correct shared secrets. The attribute dataEngage defines the public data needed for the agreement. If the mutual authentication fails, dataEngage allows detecting which parts failed.

This table shows the attributes of Smart NFTs. The standard attributes approved and operator (which help the owner to transfer ERC-721 NFTs to other owners) are omitted in the table because they are the same that in the ERC-721. Of course, they can be considered also in the proposed SmartNFT.
 
## Rationale
The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages.

## Backwards Compatibility
All EIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The EIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. EIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.

## Test Cases
Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other EIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.

## Reference Implementation
An optional section that contains a reference/example implementation that people can use to assist in understanding or implementing this specification.  If the implementation is too large to reasonably be included inline, then consider adding it as one or more files in `../assets/eip-####/`.

## Security Considerations
All EIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. EIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An EIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.
